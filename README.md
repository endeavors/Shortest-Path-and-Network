##Shortest Path and Network 

**Run:**
```c++
>>> make
>>> ./netplan <inputfile>
```
##Overview:

This program finds you the shortest path in an undirected graph using Dijkstra’s algorithm, tells you the total cost of constructing links between all networks in original graph, and as well the lowest cost of all networks by using Prim’s algorithm
